## 🎉 Projects that I have done:

1. **StuDino:** One of my earliest apps (made with the assistant of AI tools), inspired by a close friend with dyslexia. Designed to help students organise their studies, manage exam stress, and reduce anxiety.
This project sparked my interest in inclusive design and user-centred software development.
